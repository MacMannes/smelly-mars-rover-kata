**_N.B._**: I spent more üçÖ than expected, because I didn't feel very well, but
I'm having so much fun with this kata that I just kept going. Also, this was the
first time I used a Mikado plan myself, and that did slowed me down a bit.

I also spent some time trying to figure out how to use `@typescript-eslint` to
determine dead code, but it turned out it's only reporting unused variables and
unused private methods.
